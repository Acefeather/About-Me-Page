            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a recent high school graduate and first year Cybersecurity and Dance student at BYU. In my free time, I love to play video games, play the cello, and binge movies and tv shows. I have three sisters (my poor dad, I know), and a little dog named Winston. When deciding what I wanted to major in in college, I found myself entirely split between my two passions: Cybersecurity and Modern Dance. Despite their differences, I found a love for what each could offer me separately and decided to pursue a double major in both.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated from <em>Central Valley High School.</em> My passion for technology started at a young age and has only grown since then. Last year marked the beginning of my journey with Cybersecurity under the insruction of Joseph Pauley. He introduced me to the introductory concepts of Cybersecurity and Networking and encouraged me to continue pursing this field after high school.</p>
            <p>I also dedicated 15 years to my dance training at <em>Isabelle's Dance Time</em> and in various summer intensives in the Western U.S., including <em>Ballet West Academy</em>, <em>State Street Ballet</em>, and <em>Gonzaga University's</em> summer dance programs. These experiences not only prepared me for living independently from my parents, but taught me invaluable skills in cooperation, perseverence, and even the positive impact that rest can have on one's progress.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>In the past year, I've competed in competitions like the National Youth Cyber Education Program's <em>CyberPatriot</em> competition and made it to the state round at <em>SkillsUSA</em> Washington within the cybersecurity division. Both competitions offered pressure and a responsibility to my teammates that motivated me and taught me both how to rely on my abilities and to recognize when I needed help.</p>
            <p>Through the Sisters in Stem club at CVHS, I was also able to travel to nearby middle schools and educate young girls on the opportunities their are for women in STEM.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>In my Intro to Cybersecurity class at Central Valley High School, I was able to earn a Cisco Certified Support Technician Cybersecurity certification. We likewise worked within Cisco's Networking Academy to earn badges in Endpoint Security and Introduction to Cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Through my experiences both in the classroom and in competition, I pride myself on my proficiency in hardening Windows Operating Systems (including Windows Home and Windows Server). Through Cisco's Networking Academy, I am also working toward earning a badge in the essentials of the Python scripting language.</p>
